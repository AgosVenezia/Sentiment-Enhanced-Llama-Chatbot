## Project Overview
This project creates a Llama chatbot that uses Hugging Face's sentiment analysis model to adjust responses based on the emotional tone of the user's input. By detecting whether a user is feeling positive or negative, the chatbot can provide uplifting and supportive responses when necessary, making it a useful tool for mental health support. This sentiment-enhanced chatbot is implemented using Python in a Google Colab environment and utilizes Hugging Face's pre-trained sentiment analysis model.

### Features:
- Sentiment detection using Hugging Face's `distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english` model.
- Friendly, uplifting responses when negative sentiment is detected.
- A conversational loop that allows users to interact with the chatbot.

## Tools Used:
- **Google Colab**: Cloud-based coding environment.
- **Python**: For writing and executing the code.
- **Hugging Face Sentiment Analysis Model**: Pre-trained model for detecting sentiment.
